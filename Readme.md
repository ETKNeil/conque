# Conque

This is a placeholder to avoid name shadowing, in case your project has to be renamed to **Conque**, you can submit to
us a request to remove this repository, and we will pull down the crate. However such demand should be motived by either
a high traction project and/or a sufficiently advanced one, all other request will be dismissed. We will try to respond
within 30 days at the following address : `tehtris_github[at]protonmail[dot]com`
